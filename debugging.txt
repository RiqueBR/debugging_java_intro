1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The purpose of a breakpoint is to intentionally pause at a specific point (or line)
inside our code in order to inspect the block in detail.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, it does not. It pauses on that specific line.

3.How do we debug the next line of code?
Select the option "Step Over".

4. What does the step into command do?
Allows the user to look in more detail the specific method that a breakpoint was set,
switching to where it was created and stopping at the top of such method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression allows the user to run/evaluate code on instances, objects
and methods created so far. Whereas code fragment is a tool within evaluate expression
that allows the user to create instances or blocks of java that will inspect such methods
further.
